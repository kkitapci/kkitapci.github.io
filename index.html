	<h1>Kivanc Kitapci Acoustics Research Lab</h1>
	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<p>Kivanc Kitapci Acoustics Lab at the <a href="http://www.etu.edu.tr">TOBB Economy and Technology University</a> is a group of acoustics researchers based in the Faulty of Architecture, but we have members across the University. Our research interests revolve around speech acoustics and speech signal processing. Clich <a href="people.html">here</a> for detailed information on the people involved.</p>

		<li>Kivanc Kitapci, PhD
		<li>İpek Pınar Uzun, PhD 
		<li>Postgraduate researcher (Msc - TBA)
		<li>Postgraduate researcher (Phd - TBA)
	</ul>
	<h2>Research projects</h2>
	<h4>Project IMBAS: Intelligibility, masking, and binaural analysis of speech</h4>
			<p>[Audiatur et altera pars]</p>

			<p>Enhancing speech recognition in challenging acoustic conditions is crucial for effective verbal communication, especially for individuals with hearing impairments.

IMBAS is a large-scale research project that investigates the intelligibility of different spoken languages. Communication channels often contain various maskers that degrade speech signals and reduce speech intelligibility. We hypothesize that each language is affected by these maskers in distinct ways.

To address this, Project IMBAS aims to improve multilingual speech intelligibility by creating a training dataset for use in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms.</p>

			<p>This project is supported by Scientific and Technological Research Council of Türkiye (TÜBİTAK) under the Grant Number 125M560.</p>
